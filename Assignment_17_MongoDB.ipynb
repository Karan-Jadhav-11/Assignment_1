    "    \n",
    "    MongoDB is a source-available, cross-platform, document-oriented database program. It is classified as a NoSQL database product, which means it does not use the tabular schema of rows and columns found in most traditional database systems. Instead, MongoDB utilizes JSON-like documents with optional schemas. It is developed by MongoDB Inc. and is known for its exceptional speed in retrieving data, delivering consistent retrieval times, and scalability.\n",
    "\n",
    "    A non-relational database, also known as a NoSQL database, stores data in a non-tabular form, and tends to be more flexible than the traditional, SQL-based, relational database structures. Non-relational databases might be based on data structures like documents4. They offer scalability when dealing with large volumes of data and are highly efficient in distributed environments\n",
    "    \n",
    "    MongoDB is often preferred over SQL databases in the following scenarios:\n",
    "    \n",
    "    1. Handling Large Volumes of Data: MongoDB excels at managing large volumes of data by offering seamless scalability without adding complexity to the application3.\n",
    "   \n",
    "    2. Managing Complex and Evolving Data Structures: MongoDB’s flexibility and capability to handle dynamic data models and unstructured datasets make it an ideal choice for scenarios involving complex and evolving data structures3.\n",
    "    3. Developing High-Performance Applications: Non-relational databases often perform faster because a query doesn’t have to view several tables in order to deliver an answer, as relational datasets often do."

    "#### features of MongoDB.\n",
    "\n",
    "1. Document-Oriented Storage: MongoDB uses a document model, which means that data is stored as documents, and documents are grouped in collections11. This model is more natural for developers to work with because documents are self-contained and can be treated as objects.\n",
    "\n",
    "2. Flexible Schema: Documents in a single collection don’t necessarily need to have exactly the same set of fields. This flexibility allows developers to iterate faster and migrate data between different schemas without any downtime.\n",
    "\n",
    "3. Scalability: MongoDB is well known for its horizontal scaling and load balancing capabilities. It provides automatic sharding, or partitioning of data across multiple servers, enabling MongoDB to handle large-scale data across many machines.\n",
    "\n",
    "4. High Performance: MongoDB provides high performance data persistence. It supports rich query language, secondary indexes, and real-time aggregation for powerful analytical processing.\n",
    "\n",
    "5. Cloud-Based Developer Data Platform: MongoDB Atlas is the leading global cloud database service for modern applications. Developers can deploy fully managed cloud databases across AWS, Azure, and Google Cloud.\n",
    "\n",
    "6. Data Security: MongoDB offers best-in-class data security and privacy standards practices. It provides a robust set of security features, including access control, encryption at rest, encryption in transit, auditing, and more11.\n",
    "\n",
    "7. Support for Many Programming Languages: There are drivers for 10+ languages, with dozens more added by the community. This means you can create an application using any of these languages.\n",
    " \n",
    "8. BSON Format: Documents in MongoDB are stored in the BSON format, which is a binary-encoded JSON format. This allows for the storage of binary data, which is useful for storing images, videos, and other binary data.\n",
    "\n",
    "9. Support for Large Data: MongoDB also stores data far larger than relational databases. This is due to the document storage format employed by the database system called JSON."

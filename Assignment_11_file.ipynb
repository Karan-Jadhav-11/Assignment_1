    " In Python, the open() function is used to open a file. It takes two parameters: the file name/path and the mode in which you want to open the file. The basic syntax looks like this: file_object = open(file_name, mode) \n",
    "\n",
    "There are several modes you can use to open a file: \n",
    "\n",
    "'r': This is the default mode. It opens the file for reading. If the file does not exist or cannot be found, it will raise an error. \n",
    "\n",
    "'w': This mode opens the file for writing. If the file does not exist, it creates a new file. If the file already exists, it truncates the file to zero length. \n",
    "\n",
    "'a': This mode opens the file for appending. If the file does not exist, it creates a new file. If the file already exists, it appends data to the end of the file. \n",
    "\n",
    "'b': This mode is used for binary files. It can be added to the modes above, such as 'rb' or 'wb', to indicate that the file should be opened in binary mode. \n",
    "\n",
    "'+': This mode allows you to read and write to the file simultaneously. It can be added to the modes above, such as 'r+', 'w+', or 'a+'.\n",
    "\n",
    "'x': This mode is used for exclusive creation, meaning it will fail if the file already exists.\n"

    "\n",
    "Releasing Resources: When you open a file, the operating system provides a file handle to read/write the file12. If you don’t close the file, these resources are not released, which can lead to resource leakage and potentially exhaust the limit of file handles that your system can open simultaneously.\n",
    "\n",
    "Data Consistency: Many changes to files in Python do not go into effect until after the file is closed1. So, if your script edits, leaves open, and reads a file, it might not see the edits.\n",
    "\n",
    "Preventing Locks: Some operating systems lock files when they are opened by a process1. This can prevent other processes from accessing the file until it is closed.\n",
    "\n",
    "Avoiding Data Loss: When writing to a file, the data may not be written to disk until the file is closed1. The longer you keep the file open, the greater the chance that you will lose data.\n",

    "Good Programming Practice: It’s considered good programming practice to close files as soon as they are no longer needed."

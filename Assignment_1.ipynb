    "Assignment Questions \n",
    "1. Who developed Python Programming Language? \n",
    "\n",
    "Ans:- Python programming language was developed by Guido van  Rossum. The python first version  release in1991.\t\n",
    "\n",
    "2. Which type of Programming does Python support? \n",
    "\n",
    "Ans:- Python supports several programming paradigms, including:\n",
    "1) Imperative Programming: This is a programming style where you change a program’s state with statements that reflect the logic of the program.\n",
    "2) Functional Programming: This paradigm treats computation as the evaluation of mathematical functions and avoids changing state and mutable data.\n",
    "3) Procedural Programming: This paradigm focuses on writing a series of computational steps as procedures or functions.\n",
    "4) Object-Oriented Programming (OOP): This paradigm uses the concept of objects, which can contain data and code. OOP emphasizes modularity, encapsulation, inheritance, and polymorphism.\n",
    "\n",
    "3. Is Python case sensitive when dealing with identifiers? \n",
    "\n",
    "Ans: Yes, Python is case-sensitive when it comes to identifiers This means that variables, function names, class names, and other identifiers must be typed with consistent capitalization throughout the code.For example, variables \"my_variable\" and \"My_Variable\" would be treated as two different identifiers in Python.\n",
    "\n",
    "4. What is the correct extension of the Python file? \n",
    "\n",
    "Ans: The correct file extension for Python source code files is \".py\". When you save a Python script, you should use a file name with the \".py\" extension. For example, you might save your Python code in a file named \"name.py\".\n",
    "\n",
    "5. Is Python code compiled or interpreted? \n",
    "\n",
    "Ans:\n",
    "Python is both compiled and interpreted. The Python programming language uses a two-step process: python program is first compiled and then interpreted. The compilation part is hidden from the programmer thus, many programmers believe that it is an interpreted language.\n",
    "\n",
    "6. Name a few blocks of code used to define in Python language? \n",
    "\n",
    "Ans: Here are a few blocks of code used to define different components in Python:\n",
    "Module: A module is a file containing Python definitions and statements. You can create a module by creating a .py file and defining functions, classes, or variables in it. Here’s an example:\n",
    "#### mymodule.py\n",
    "def hello():\n",
    "    print(\"Hello, world!\")\n",
    "\n",
    "Function: A function is a block of code designed to carry out a specified task. Functions help break our program into smaller and modular chunks for better organization and code reuse. Here’s an example:\n",
    "def greet(name):\n",
    "    \"\"\"Greet a person with a formal salutation.\"\"\"\n",
    "    print(f\"Hello, {name}!\")\n",
    "\n",
    "Class Definition: A class is a code template for creating objects. Object-oriented programming is a programming paradigm based on the concept of “objects”, which can contain data and code: data in the form of fields (often known as attributes), and code, in the form of procedures (often known as methods). Here’s an example:\n",
    "class Person:\n",
    "    \"\"\"A simple person class.\"\"\"\n",
    "\n",
    "    def __init__(self, name, age):\n",
    "        \"\"\"Initialize the person.\"\"\"\n",
    "        self.name = name\n",
    "        self.age = age\n",
    "\n",
    "    def greet(self):\n",
    "        \"\"\"Greet a person with a formal salutation.\"\"\"\n",
    "        print(f\"Hello, {self.name}! You are {self.age} years old.\")\n",
    "Control Flow Blocks: These blocks are comprised of if, elif, and else statements that control the flow of the program based on specific conditions. Since Python doesn’t have block indicators to specify the end of a block, the pass keyword is used to specify that the block is intentionally left blank. Here’s an example:\n",
    "if age < 13:\n",
    "    pass  # do nothing\n",
    "elif 13 <= age < 18:\n",
    "    print(\"You are a teenager.\")\n",
    "else:\n",
    "    print(\"You are an adult.\")\n",
    "\n",
    "As you learn more about Python, understanding the proper use of keywords and writing well-organized code blocks is essential for improving your skills and writing more efficient and readable code.\n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "7. State a character used to give single-line comments in Python? \n",
    "\n",
    "Ans:In Python, the character used to indicate a single-line comment is the hash symbol (#). Any text following the # symbol on the same line is treated as a comment and is ignored by the Python interpreter.\n",
    "example: # This is a single-line comment in Python\n",
    "\n",
    "8. Mention functions which can help us to find the version of python that we are currently working on? \n",
    "\n",
    "Ans: 1) Using command line:\n",
    "Open a terminal or command prompt and type the following command:\n",
    "python --version\n",
    "2) in Python 3:\n",
    "python3 --version\n",
    "for more detailed information:\n",
    "python3 -V\n",
    "3) Using platform module:\n",
    "import platform\n",
    "print(\"Python version:\")\n",
    "print(platform.python_version())\n",
    "The platform module provides a method called python_version() that returns a string representing the Python version.\n",
    "\n",
    "9. Python supports the creation of anonymous functions at runtime, using a construct called \n",
    "Ans:In Python, the creation of anonymous functions at runtime is supported through a construct called \"lambda\" functions. Lambda functions are a way to create small, unnamed, and inline functions. The syntax for a lambda function is:\n",
    "lambda arguments: expression\n",
    "Here's an example of a simple lambda function that adds two numbers:\n",
    "add = lambda x, y: x + y\n",
    "result = add(3, 5)\n",
    "print(result)  # Outputs: 8\n",
    "In this example, lambda x, y: x + y defines an anonymous function that takes two arguments (x and y) and returns their sum. The lambda function is assigned to the variable add, and then it is called with the arguments 3 and 5, resulting in the output 8.\n",
    "Lambda functions are often used for short, one-time operations, especially in cases where a full function definition is unnecessary.\n",
    "\n",
    "10. What does pip stand for python? \n",
    "Ans: PIP stands for \"pip Install Packages\" and is the standard tool for installing Python packages and their dependencies in a secure manner.\n",
    " It is a command-line utility that allows users to download and manage Python packages from the Python Package Index (PyPI) or other package repositories.\n",
    " Most recent distributions of Python come with pip preinstalled. The Python pip install –user command is used to downgrade a package to a specific version.\n",
    " PIP is a recursive acronym for \"Preferred Installer Program\" or PIP Installs Packages. It is a command-line utility that installs, reinstalls, or uninstalls PyPI packages with one simple command: pip.\n",
    "\n",
    "11. Mention a few built-in functions in python? \n",
    "Ans: Python built-in functions are pre-defined functions that come bundled with Python and can be used directly in a Python program without importing external libraries. They provide essential and commonly used functionality for various tasks, such as data type conversion, mathematical operations, string manipulation, file operations, etc.\n",
    "1) print(): This function is used to output data to the standard output device (like a screen). Here’s an example:\n",

    "\n",
    "5) min(): This function is used to get the minimum value in a sequence or a list of numbers. Here’s an example:\n",
    "numbers = [5, 10, 15, 20]\n",
    "print(min(numbers))  # Output: 5\n",
    "\n",
    "6) sum(): This function is used to get the sum of all the elements in a list of numbers. Here’s an example:\n",
    "numbers = [5, 10, 15, 20]\n",
    "print(sum(numbers))  # Output: 50\n",
    "\n",
    "8) range(): This function is used to generate a sequence of numbers. Here’s an example:\n",
    "for i in range(5):\n",

    "12) Interpreted language: Python is interpreted, which allows for easier debugging and code development.\n",
    "\n",
    "14. How is memory managed in Python? \n",
    "\n",
    "ANS:Memory management in Python is primarily handled by the Python memory manager, which is part of the Python runtime environment. The memory manager is responsible for allocating memory for Python objects, managing the heap, and freeing up memory when objects are no longer needed.\n",
    "Here are some key points to consider when it comes to memory management in Python:\n",
    "1) Reference Counting: Each Python object has a reference count associated with it. This count is incremented every time a new reference is created to the object, and decremented every time a reference is destroyed. When the reference count reaches zero, the object is deallocated and its memory is freed.\n",
    "Memory Allocation: The memory manager allocates memory in blocks called “pages.” When an object is created, the memory manager first checks 2) if there is enough free memory in the current page to allocate the object. If not, it allocates a new page. When an object is deallocated, its memory is returned to the current page, and can be reused for new objects.\n",
    "Automatic Garbage Collection: In addition to reference counting, Python also includes a garbage collector that can identify and deallocate “cyclic” objects that are no longer reachable. A cyclic object is an object that has a reference to itself, either directly or indirectly, and would therefore never have its reference count reach zero under normal circumstances.\n",
    "3) Memory Efficiency: Python optimizes memory utilization by allocating the same object reference to a new variable if the object already exists with the same value. For example, if you assign the integer 5 to two different variables, both variables will reference the same object in memory.\n",
    "\n",
    "15. How to install Python on Windows and set path variables? \n",
    "\n",
    "Ans:Installing Python on Windows is a straightforward process, and setting the path variables allows you to run Python from any command prompt. Here are step-by-step instructions:\n",
    "Installing Python:\n",
    "Download Python:\n",
    "Visit the official Python website: Python Downloads.\n",
    "Choose the latest version for Windows (for example, Python 3.9.7).\n",
    "Select the appropriate installer based on your system architecture (32-bit or 64-bit). Most modern systems are 64-bit.\n",
    "Run the Installer:\n",
    "Double-click the downloaded installer (e.g., python-3.9.7-amd64.exe) to start the installation.\n",
    "Customize Installation (Optional):\n",
    "During the installation, you'll have the option to customize the installation.\n",
    "Ensure to check the box that says \"Add Python 3.x to PATH\" before proceeding.\n",
    "You can also customize the installation location if needed.\n",
    "Complete the Installation:\n",
    "Click on the \"Install Now\" button to start the installation.\n",
    "The installer will copy files and set up Python. Once completed, you'll see a screen indicating a successful installation.\n",
    "Setting Path Variables:\n",
    "After installing Python, you need to set the system PATH variable to include the directory where Python is installed. This allows you to run Python from any command prompt.\n",
    "Find Python Installation Directory:\n",
    "The default installation directory is usually C:\\Users\\YourUsername\\AppData\\Local\\Programs\\Python\\Python3.x (replace YourUsername with your actual Windows username).\n",
    "Copy Python Installation Directory Path:\n",
    "Copy the path to the Python installation directory.\n",
    "Set PATH Environment Variable:\n",
    "Right-click on the Windows Start button and select \"System.\"\n",
    "Click on \"Advanced system settings\" on the left.\n",
    "In the System Properties window, click on the \"Environment Variables...\" button.\n",
    "Edit System PATH Variable:\n",
    "In the Environment Variables window, under the \"System variables\" section, find and select the \"Path\" variable, then click on the \"Edit...\" button.\n",
    "Add Python Directory to PATH:\n",
    "Click on the \"New\" button and paste the path to the Python installation directory.\n",
    "Verify Installation:\n",
    "Open a new command prompt and type python or python --version to verify that Python is installed and the PATH variable is set correctly.\n",
    "\n",
    "16. Is indentation required in python? \n",
    "\n",
    "Ans: Yes, indentation is required in Python and plays a crucial role in structuring the code. Unlike other programming languages where indentation is used for readability only, Python uses indentation to indicate a block of code. If you skip the indentation, Python will raise an error. The number of spaces for indentation is up to the programmer, but it has to be at least one space and consistent throughout the same block of code. Here’s an example to demonstrate the importance of indentation in Python:\n",
    "if 5 > 2:\n",
    "    print(\"Five is greater than two!\")\n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "In this example, the print statement is part of the if statement block because it is indented. If you don’t indent it, you will get an error.\n",
    "\n",
    "\n"
